# Project Files Explanation

This document explains the importance and purpose of every file in the Machine Learning Final Project.

## 📁 Core Project Files

### 1. `requirements.txt`
**Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical)

**Purpose:**
- Lists all Python packages and their versions needed for the project
- Ensures consistent environment setup across different machines
- Makes it easy to install all dependencies with one command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Contains:**
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computing
- matplotlib: Plotting and visualization
- seaborn: Statistical data visualization
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- jupyter: Interactive notebook environment
- scipy: Scientific computing

**Why it's important:** Without this file, you'd have to manually install each package and remember exact versions. This file ensures anyone can recreate your exact working environment.

### 2. `generate_dirty_data.py`
**Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical)

**Purpose:**
- Generates the initial "dirty" dataset required for the project
- Creates a CSV file with 12,500+ rows and 16 columns
- Intentionally introduces data quality issues for cleaning practice

**What it does:**
1. Creates synthetic customer data (age, charges, services, etc.)
2. Introduces missing values (1,009 missing values)
3. Adds duplicate rows (478 duplicates)
4. Creates outliers (extreme values)
5. Adds inconsistent data entry (different cases: "Yes"/"yes"/"Y")
6. Inserts blank spaces
7. Adds invalid negative values

**Why it's important:** 
- The project requires a "dirty" dataset with at least 10,000 rows
- This script creates realistic data quality issues that need to be cleaned
- Must be run FIRST before running the main project script
- Demonstrates data generation skills

**Usage:** `python generate_dirty_data.py`
